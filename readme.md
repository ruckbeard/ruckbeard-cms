This is a blog/CMS that I was designing to test my programming abilities. It is not finished by any means.

Comes with a copy of the MySQL database. The database file is playerdirectory.sql.

Users are allowed to register and login. Contains an admin area to create and moderate content.

Uses Savant3 templating system for easy seperation of the HTML and JavaScript from the PHP side of the code. Uses TinyMCE as a WYSIWYG text editor for writing blog posts. Uses HTMLPurifier to filter comments and other user input.

Has many different features such as ability to like posts, like or share using social media, and tag posts. I was also able to implement features similar to WordPress when creating posts.
